## UW ITE Data Collection Project

Release Date: Feb 23, 2020
{: .label .label-purple }

Each year, ITE Western District creates a Data Collection Fund to encourage Student Chapter involvement with the profession. UW ITE chapter recently won another proposal for a annual data collection project. The committee was impressed by the quality of our previous deliveries as well as the value and uniqueness of the site for this year's project.

We are working at Shell on the 45th Street (near the University District Building), collecting count data of vehicles, bicyclists, bus passengers, and pedestrians who enter this gas station that has various amenities. It will provide relevant technical data in the West for transportation engineers and planners.

We are planning to work in 2-hour shifts from 7am-6pm on February 25 (Tuesday) and 26 (Wednesday). To make it a successful project, a collaborative effort is necessary. We are seeking volunteers from our CEE community that could sign up for times they are available to help. Being a part of this project is fun and beneficial to the overall academic and professional development.

This project will help you gain experience on the collection of basic data with focus on real world selection process and on practical, day-to-day, minor research in transportation engineering and planning. Additionally, students registered for CEE 412/CET 522 will receive an extra 1.5 points towards their final grade.

We will also be having a draw for two Amazon gift cars ($25 each) at the end of the project and will be providing complimentary refreshments.
